# Deep-Generative-Models
Working with pytorch to build different deep generative models.

## DL_CNN

- To introduce myself with pytorch. I started by building models of some Deep Learning models, as a basic fully connected feed-forward netowrk and a CNN.

## Autoregressive Models 

- In this case, using a GRU and a cropus of Shakespear's text. I builded a model to learn how to replicate it.

## VAE

- Here I explore different VAE architectures for digit generation with the MNIST dataset. The models I tried are:
1) VAE with continuous latent spaces, modeling a Gaussian distribution.
2) Beta-VAE, adding beta parameter to the VAE to control the desintanglement of the latent space.
3) VAE with discrete latent spaces, 10 classes, one for each digit.

## GAN's
